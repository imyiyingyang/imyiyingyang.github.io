      <p class="essayname"><strong>Essay Name:The Involvement of Asian American Undergraduate Students</strong></p>
      <p><img src="img/diversity.jpeg" alt="diversity" /></p>
      <p class="content">Compared to other minority racial and ethnic groups, Asian Americans have large populations in higher education nationally. A large number of Asian American students pursue college degrees and enroll in American colleges and universities. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of Asian American undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in institutions of higher education increased by about 430,000 students, from approximately 0.91 million to about 1.34 million. Asian American students are commonly depicted as academic super- stars or model minorities. According to the model-minority stereotype, Asian Americans are successful in school because they work hard and come from cultures that believe in the value of education (Lee, 1994).</p>
      <p class="content">However, due to the model minority assumption, many federal agencies exclude Asian Americans from opportunities, resources, and discussions (Ching & Agbayani, 2012). Moreover, Asian American students are ignored by postsecondary educators who assume that they do not need support (Museus & Park, 2012). In a word, Asian American students are a misunderstood population. The absence of an understanding of Asian American student in higher education should be focused by the federal government and other educational organizations. For example, much of the research on college student suggests that there is a positive relationship between students who are involved in the campus environment and their success in their college life. However, most research would target at African American, Hispanic American, fraternity and sorority, or first generation students. There is still a lack of research on Asian American students.</p>
      <p class="content">The purpose of this mini-study is to explorer the factors that are associated with college involvements for Asian American students. Specifically it will examine the factors that enhance or impede involvement for this group. Background information on Asian American students will be presented first. Then it will be followed by a review of the research on involvement of Asian American undergraduates. Next the method will be presented with a description of the two students that were interviewed followed by a description of major findings from the interviews related to the research, and finally a discussion of the implications.</p>

       <p class="essayname"><strong>Essay Name:Comparison of the United States and China’s Systems of Higher Education</strong></p>
       <p><img src="img/history.jpg" alt="history" />
       <p class="content">China, as one of the four ancient civilizations, has a long tradition in higher education. Ancient Chinese civilization originated in the second millennium B.C and higher education has been developing for more than 4,000 years. In contrast, the United States, although it has been in existence for only about 200 years, has quickly become one of the most advanced countries in the world. It has not only advanced in economic development, but also in the equality of its education. </p>
       <p class="content">The different cultural backgrounds of the two countries have resulted in different education systems. From the earliest times, Chinese education emphasized the importance of civic morality, and students were required to respect knowledge and authority (Domonkos, 1989). On the contrary, the United States sees more value in personality, so educators pay more attention to cultivating students’ ability to query and think.</p>
       <p class="content">In the 1960s, Chinese higher education experienced a difficult time in which the anti-intellectualism prevailed throughout the country. During the 1990s, however, the Chinese government reflected on its mistakes and realized the importance of education, so they initiated a series of reforms of the educational system. Chinese higher education began to move toward mass education. As a result, the number of institutions increased, as did student enrollments.</p>
       <p class="content">As for the United States, it is no exaggeration to say its higher education started at the same time that the county was established. After 200 years, the mature U.S. education system consisted of comprehensive institutions, research universities, community colleges, and liberal arts colleges (Cohen & Kisker, 2010).</p>
       <p class="content">The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast the higher education systems of the United States and China. A comparison of some key aspects of the systems (students, admissions/access and governance) will be presented, as will an analysis of the similarities and differences in the two systems. Some strengths and weaknesses of the two systems will then be discussed, which will provide lessons for the future of higher education.</p>
